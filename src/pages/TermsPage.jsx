                CreatorMatch is an online marketplace that connects clients with professional content creators
                including videographers, photographers, podcast producers, drone operators, and other creative professionals.
                We provide the tools, infrastructure, and payment system to help creative work get done safely and professionally.
              </p>
              <p>
                By creating an account or using our platform in any capacity, you agree to these Terms of Service.
                If you do not agree, please do not use CreatorMatch.
              </p>
              <p>
                These terms apply to all users of the platform: creators offering services, clients seeking services,
                and any visitors browsing the marketplace.
              </p>
            </Section>

            <Section id="how-it-works" title="2. How CreatorMatch Works" dark={dark}>
              <p>
                CreatorMatch operates as a two-sided marketplace. Creators list their services, packages, and rates.
                Clients browse the directory, request quotes, and book projects through the platform.
              </p>
              <p>
                All financial transactions are processed through CreatorMatch using Stripe, a licensed payment processor.
                CreatorMatch never holds funds indefinitely: payment is split into a 50% retainer at booking and 50% upon
                project completion and approval. Funds are released to the creator after client approval or after 7 days
                with no response.
              </p>
              <p>
                CreatorMatch earns revenue through a platform fee charged to both parties. This fee structure is described
                in Section 5. Fees and Payments.
              </p>
            </Section>

            <Section id="accounts" title="3. Account Requirements" dark={dark}>
              <p>

              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2">
                <li>Be at least 18 years of age</li>

              </ul>
              <p>
                Creators must additionally connect a Stripe payment account to receive payments. Identity verification
                is handled automatically through Stripe's Know Your Customer (KYC) process.
              </p>
              <p>
                You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials. CreatorMatch is not
                liable for losses resulting from unauthorized account access due to your failure to secure your credentials.

              </ul>
              <p>
                Circumventing this requirement is a serious violation and may result in account suspension and recovery
                of any platform fees that would have been due. We implement monitoring systems including message filtering

              </p>
              <p>
                All payments are processed through Stripe and are subject to Stripe's standard processing fees,

                Refunds, when applicable, are processed within 5 to 10 business days depending on your bank or payment provider.

            <Section id="communication" title="7. Communication Policy" dark={dark}>
              <p>
                All initial communication between clients and creators must occur through the CreatorMatch messaging system.
                This protects both parties and ensures a record of project discussions.

              <p>
                CreatorMatch uses automated message filtering to detect and block contact information in messages.
                Repeated attempts to share contact information through messages will trigger the violation system
                described in Section 8.
              </p>
              <p>
                After a paid retainer is processed, direct contact information (email and phone) becomes visible
                to the specific client who booked, so project communication may continue through any channel.
