            <p>
              CreatorBridge is an online platform connecting content creators with brands and clients seeking
              media production and digital content services. Our community includes videographers, photographers,
              podcast producers, drone operators, and other creative professionals across every market and specialty.
              We provide the tools, infrastructure, and payment system to help creative work get done safely and professionally.
            </p>
            <p>
              By creating an account or using our platform in any capacity, you agree to these Terms of Service.
              If you do not agree, please do not use CreatorBridge.
            </p>
            <p>
              These terms apply to all users of the platform: creators offering services, clients seeking services,
              and any visitors browsing the marketplace.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section id="how-it-works" title="2. How CreatorBridge Works" dark={dark}>
            <p>
              CreatorBridge operates as a two-sided marketplace. Creators list their services, packages, and rates.
              Clients browse the directory, request quotes, and book projects through the platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              All financial transactions are processed through CreatorBridge using Stripe, a licensed payment processor.
              CreatorBridge never holds funds indefinitely: payment is split into a 50% retainer at booking and 50% upon
              project completion and approval. Funds are released to the creator after client approval or after 72 hours
              with no response.
            </p>
            <p>
              CreatorBridge earns revenue through a platform fee charged to both parties. This fee structure is described
              in Section 5. Fees and Payments.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section id="accounts" title="3. Account Requirements" dark={dark}>
            <p>
              To use CreatorBridge, you must:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2">
              <li>Be at least 18 years of age</li>
              <li>Provide accurate, truthful registration information</li>
              <li>Verify your phone number via SMS during signup</li>
              <li>Agree to these Terms of Service</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Creators must additionally:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2">
              <li>Complete identity verification through Stripe Connect (required for all creators before receiving payments)</li>
              <li>Carry their own business insurance and professional liability coverage</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Identity verification for creators is handled automatically through Stripe's Know Your Customer (KYC) process.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each creator may only maintain one active profile on CreatorBridge. Creating multiple profiles
              is a violation of these Terms and may result in suspension of all associated accounts.
            </p>
            <p>
              You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials. CreatorBridge is not
              liable for losses resulting from unauthorized account access due to your failure to secure your credentials.

            </p>
            <p>
              This requirement applies equally to both parties:

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2">
              <li>Clients may not contact, hire, or pay creators discovered on CreatorBridge outside of the platform during this 24-month period.</li>
              <li>Creators may not solicit, accept, or fulfill work from clients introduced through CreatorBridge outside of the platform during this 24-month period.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Circumventing this requirement is a serious violation and may result in account suspension and recovery
              of any platform fees that would have been due.

          <Section id="cancellation" title="6. Cancellation and Refunds" dark={dark}>
            <p>
              CreatorBridge uses a simple three-rule cancellation policy to protect both clients and creators.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-2">
              <li>

                This applies when the project has been accepted but the creator has not yet started production.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className={dark ? 'text-white' : 'text-gray-900'}>Rule 2 - After work begins:</strong> Creator keeps 50% of the total project value.

              <li>
                <strong className={dark ? 'text-white' : 'text-gray-900'}>Rule 3 - After delivery:</strong> No refund. Creator retains 100% of the project payment once work has been delivered.

              Refunds, when applicable, are processed within 5 to 10 business days depending on your bank or payment provider.

          <Section id="communication" title="7. Communication Policy" dark={dark}>
            <p>
              All initial communication between clients and creators must occur through the CreatorBridge messaging system.
              This protects both parties and ensures a record of project discussions.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className={dark ? 'text-white' : 'text-gray-900'}>Sharing contact information through the platform's messaging system before a paid booking is completed is a violation of these Terms.</strong>{' '}

            <p>
              After a paid retainer is processed, direct contact information (email and phone) becomes visible
              to the specific client who booked, so project communication may continue through any channel.
